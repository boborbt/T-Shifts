// # TODO
// 
// ## More event types
// The interface should allow to add as much event types as necessary.
// Ideally the most common ones should be fast to add to the shifts
//
// ## Events editing
// The app should be able to read from the given calendar the events that the
// itself added. It should also be able to edit and update them.
//
// ## Better events visualization
// The main event display should be a calendar view
//
// ## Automatic alarms
// The app should allow to set a clock alarm for each event type. For instance
// one should be able to specify that an alarm have to fire at 6 a.m. every day
// where a morning shift has been set.
